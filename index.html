           Balzan Metalcraft is well established workshop that specializes in handcrafted metal furnishings such as gates, fences, balcony railings and spiral staircases.
            Additionally, it sells smaller items such as wall hooks, shelves and signs and allows customers to order custom furnishings to their liking. Each piece is made using traditional
             methods such as scrollwork, where the metal is bended into decorative spirals or curves, perfect for railings or gates. The workshop is located in Balzan and was founded 50 years ago. 
             The owner is Matthew Borg, a skilled artisan with 30 years of experience.
